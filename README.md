# üéÆ Sync Dash

A fast-paced hyper-casual mobile game built in Unity where players control a glowing cube to jump over obstacles and collect orbs ‚Äî while a ghost player on the left side mirrors their moves in real-time, simulating network play without an actual server.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Concept

**Sync Dash** divides the screen into two vertical halves:

* **Right Side** ‚Äì Player controls a glowing cube that moves forward automatically. The player taps to jump, avoids obstacles, and collects glowing orbs.
* **Left Side** ‚Äì A "ghost player" mirrors the real player's actions with a configurable delay and smooth interpolation, simulating networked multiplayer behavior locally.

The game challenges players to score high while maintaining smooth gameplay and impressive visuals with optimized performance.

### üß† Real-Time Syncing

* Left side character **mirrors the player's actions** (jumping, movement, orb collection, obstacle hit).
* Optional **configurable delay** to simulate network lag.
* **Interpolation and smoothing** to mimic real-time sync accurately.
* Uses a **queue-based state buffer** to simulate multiplayer state syncing.

### üí• Shaders & Visual Effects (Mandatory Bonus Features)

* **Glowing Shader**: Applied to the main cube for a stylized look.
* **Dissolve Shader**: Obstacles dissolve when hit.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Mechanics & Logic)

### Player Controller

* Continuously moves forward on the **right half** of the screen.
* Tap = Jump
* Collides with:

  * **Obstacles** = Game Over
  * **Orbs** = Score Increase

### Ghost Player

* Placed on **left half** of the screen.
* Receives state updates (position, rotation, jump, orb collection) from Player using a **queue**.
* Interpolates between buffered states for **smooth movement**.
* Simulates slight network latency using a **configurable delay**.
